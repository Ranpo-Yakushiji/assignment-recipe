        </div>
        <div class="buzhou">
        <ol>
            <li>Put the chocolate, butter and 75ml warm water (see tip, below) in a heatproof bowl set over a pan of barely simmering water. Push the chocolate and butter gently into the warm water with a wooden spoon to help it melt, but avoid stirring too much. Once three-quarters of the butter and chocolate is melted, remove the bowl from the heat. Stir until melted, smooth and glossy. Set aside until lukewarm.</li>
            <li>Working quickly, use a spatula to stir the egg yolks into the chocolate mixture, one at a time. In a separate bowl, use an electric whisk to whip the egg whites to soft peaks, then gradually add the sugar, whisking, until stiff peaks form.</li>
            <li>Gently fold about a fifth of the egg whites into the chocolate mixture, then fold in the rest, being careful not to knock out the air bubbles. Pour into wine or dessert glasses, cover with clingfilm and chill overnight to set</li>
            <li>When ready to serve, whip the cream (if using) to soft peaks. Top each glass with a spoonful of cream and decorate with chocolate shards, if you like. </li>

    How To Do?

</div>
<div class="lol">
    <ol>
        <li>To make the panna cotta, put the gelatine in a bowl of cold water and leave to soften. Put 2 tablespoons of the milk in a small bowl with the matcha and whisk until
            smooth. Stir in the remaining milk. Pour into a saucepan, add the cream and sugar and heat until hot but not quite boiling.</li>
        <li>Lift the softened gelatine from the water and lower into the hot matcha mixture, stirring for a few secomds intil the gelatine has dissolved.
            Tip into a jug for easy pouring and leave until cold but not beginning to set. Stir the mixture well in case the matcha has setteled
        at the base of the jug and pour into six 125-150ml or any other small metal moulds. Chill for at least 4hours. </li>
        <li>For the compote, cut each stick of rhubarb lengthways into four thin pieces. Cut each piece across into 4cm lengths. Put the sugar in a saucepan with
            3 tablespoons water and heat until the sugar dissolved. Add the rhubarb and cook briefly until slightly softened but not falling apart. Stir gently once or twice.
            Tip the rhubarb and juices into a bowl and leave to cool.
