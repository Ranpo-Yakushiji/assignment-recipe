<i><h1 id="ha">Monkfish Risotto with Matchasabi</i></h1>

    Ingredients:
</div>
<div class="prp">
    <ol>
        <li>300g/10oz monkfish fillet, cut into small pieces</li>
        <li>sea salt and freshly ground black pepper</li>
        <li>50g/2oz/ 1/4 cup butter</li>
        <li>1 large onion, finely chopped</li>
        <li>2 garlic cloves, crushed</li>
        <li>1 tsp wasabi paste</li>
        <li>1 tsp matcha</li>
        <li>approx 1 litre/35fl oz/ 4 1/4 cups hot fish stock</li>
        <li>250g/9oz/generous 1 cup risotto rice</li>
        <li>150ml/5fl oz/ 2/3 cup dry white wine</li>
        <li>3 tbsp chopped fresh parsley or chervil</li>
    </ol>

    How To Do?

</div>
<div class="lol">
    <ol>
        <li>Season the fish with salth and pepper.Melt half the butter in a large saucepan and gently fry the onion for 2 minutes. Add the garlic and fish, and cook gently for 2 minutes. Lift the fish out onto a plate.</li>
        <li>Whisk the wasabi and matcha woth a few tablespoons of the stock in a small bowl and reserve.</li>
        <li>Add the rice to the pan and cook, strring, for 1 minute. Pour in the wine and let it bubble until almost completely evaporated.
            Stir in a ladleful of the hot stock and cook until absorbed. Continue to cook, adding the stock a ladleful at a time and stirring for a couple of
            minutes before adding more stock. Cook until the rice has softened but retains a little bite. It should be quite juicy-you might not need all the stock.
        </li>
        <li>Return the fish to the pan with the matcha mixture and parsley or chervil. Dot in the remaining butter, mix well until the butter melts and season to taste before serving.</li>
